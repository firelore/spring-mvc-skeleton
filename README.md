spring-mvc-skeleton
===

This is a barebones Spring Web MVC project to be used for bootstrapping new Spring web applications.

It is set up with the following:

* Spring is using Java configuration instead of xml files
* Not using `web.xml`. Instead it is using Spring's `WebApplicationInitializer`.
* JSP for views. This is pretty much the default for any server out there so it is the most supported out of the box.
